    match /userMenus/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
    
    // Allow users to read and write their own settings
    match /userSettings/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
  }
}
